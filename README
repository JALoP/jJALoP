This project provides a Java Producer (JALPTest)

The following libraries are included in the 3rd-party directory:
  JUDS


Building and Installing
This project uses the maven (maven.apache.org) build tool version 3.0.4 or higher and will
compile under Java 1.8.

Installation Instructions:

1. Download and install maven
	(Follow instructions at http://maven.apache.org/download.html)

2. Install JUDS
	- Make sure libgcc.i686 and glibc-devel.i686 are installed
	- From the 3rd-Party/JUDS directory, run 'sh autoconf.sh' to create the
	configure file
	- Update the JAVA_HOME variable in the makefile if necessary (JAVA_HOME must be set before running configure)
	    -Ex: export JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk
	- From the 3rd-Party/JUDS directory, run './configure' to create the
	makefile
	- Run 'make'
	- Run 'make install'

3. Install JUDS dependency with maven
	- From jjalop directory, run:
		mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.etsy.net -DartifactId=juds \
		-Dversion=0.94 -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=3rd-Party/JUDS/juds-0.94.jar

4. Package JALoP project
	- Run 'mvn package'


Installation Instructions for JALPTest:

1. Create jjalop-1.0.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar with the above installation
instructions.

2. Install jjalop dependency with maven
	- From the jjalop/utils/JalpTest directory, run:
		mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=com.tresys.jalop \
		-DartifactId=jjalop -Dversion=1.0.0.2 -Dpackaging=jar \
		-Dfile=../../target/jjalop-1.0.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar

3. Package JALPTest project
	- Run 'mvn package'

4. To run the JALPTest jar
	- From the jjalop/utils/JalpTest directory, run:
		java -cp target/jalptest-1.0.0.2-jar-with-dependencies.jar \
		JALPTest <options>

Usage for JALPTest:
-a      (optional) the full, or relative path to a file to use for generating
	the application metadata.
-p      The full or relative path to a file that should be used as the payload
	for this particular record.
-s      Indicates the payload should be taken from <stdin>.
-t, --type=T    Indicates which type of data to send: 'j' (journal record),
	'a' (audit record), 'l' (log entry), or 'f' (journal record using file
	descriptor passing).
-h      Print a summary of options.
-j      The full or relative path to the JALoP socket.
-k      The full or relative path to a private key file to be used for signing.
	Must also specify '-a'.
-b      The full or relative path to a public key file to be used for signing.
	Must also specify '-a'.
-c      The full or relative path to a certificate file to be used for signing.
	Requires '-k'.
-d      Calculates and adds a SHA256 digest of the payload to the application
	metadata. Must also specify '-a'.


Other Options (these steps do not need to be executed in order to use the JALoP
libraries)
To run the unit tests and generate code coverage reports, run
$ mvn test
The generated code coverage reports will appear in the directory coverage-report

To clean the target directory, run
$ mvn clean

To generate Javadoc documentation, run
$ mvn site
The generated documents will appear in the directory target/site


All of the source code for the implementation is under the 'src' directory. The
src directory is divided into different sections based on functionality, subdirs
such as producer, common, etc.

A JALoP log4j appender is supplied with the Java implementation of JALoP.  The
Configuration parameters for this appender are:
  path - The path to the jalop socket file
  hostName - The name of the host machine
  appName - The name of the application that will be using the logger
  useLocation - A boolean value used to set whether location information will
		be included in the log or not
  privateKeyPath - An optional path to the private key that will be used for signing
  publicKeyPath - An optional path to the public key that will be used for signing
  certPath - An optional path to the certificate that will be used for signing
